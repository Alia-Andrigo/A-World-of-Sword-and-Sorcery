<section> <h2>Origins of the World</h2> </section>

<section> <p>While many mortals attribute the creation of the world to one or more of their deities it is impossible to know which of these is true.  What we do know is that a few centuries ago mortal civilization began in the lands north of the Vyrkosi Sea.  With the guidance of their gods these peoples created great cities and began to farm the land.  Since then history has been shaped by many powerful heroes and the gods that they follow.  It is unclear what the future holds but it will doubtless see the rise of new cities, new gods, and new heroes.</p>

<section> <h3>Calendar Systems</h3> </section>
<section> <p>There are three main calendars used in the civilized world.</p>
<p>The first and oldest is the Elvish calendar, its start date is the destruction of The First City.  As Elves spread out after the fall of The First City the calendar was brought with them to the many regions they settled in.  This sadly led to a fracture of the calendar into several different timelines.  The lack of consistency makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact date of a historical event but it is still a helpful reference, especially for those early years not covered in other calendars.  <br><strong>The current year is between 419 - 438.</strong></p>
<p>The most used calendar is the Vyrkosi Standard, which starts with the reign Vyrkon III of Oralid.  This system was designed by the scholar Telemon and is centered around the reigns of Oralid's rulers.  This does lead to some issues with excluding years during power struggles but it is otherwise thought to be quite accurate.  <br><strong>The current year is the 17th year of Maldros II or 261.</strong></p>
<p>The newest is the Toranian calendar which starts with the founding of Tyrania.  This calendar is favored by scholars since it is extremely accurate.  One of its creators, Xanthrel is still alive today!  While it is mostly only used in Tyrania and Vaelosk it seems to be gaining popularity as the city-state's influence grows.  <br><strong>The current year is 112.</strong></p>
