<section> <h2>Main Cultural Groups </h2> </section>

<section> <p><strong>Calar</strong></p>
<p>The Calar primarily reside in the desert to the far West of the known world. They are known as expert hunters able to fell the great beasts that roam the desert.  Their primary deity and namesake Calar was said to have once been a normal human. While there are Calar enclaves throughout most cities their main settlement Calar's Rest is nestled deep in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>Elvish</strong></p>
<p>The Elves are one of the oldest cultural groups.  They founded the first great civilization in the far north beyond the Gethic Wode.  After some unknown calamity the city was destroyed and many of them came South.  They are now fairly spread out across various regions and have adopted the practices of their new communities.  The primary gods of their pantheon are Pelia the creator of the elves, Valios the creator of the ocean, and Halia the creator of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Toranians</strong></p>
<p>The Toranians inhabit the cities of Tyrania and Vaelosk on opposite sides of Lake Tyria.  They were originally a logging towns that supplied the Vyrkosi city-states with ship lumber.  They have now grown to become one of the most powerful factions in the world. They are ruled by a council of twenty-seven nobles that are elected to their positions by the popular vote.</p>
<p><strong>Vyrkosi</strong></p>
<p>The Vyrkosi are the by far the largest culture in the region.  They are the majority in most settlements along the Vyrkosi Sea.  The most notable examples of these include: Oralid, Brelen, Salioch, Masillia, and Norion.  They are excellent ship builders which has allowed the coastal cities to flourish from trade.
